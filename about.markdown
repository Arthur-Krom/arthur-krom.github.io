Just some information about my current 'tech stack'.

## Programming languages

As you might've read on the homepage; my name is Arthur and I am a Software Engineering student at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. Over the past couple of years I have come to work with various programming languages, frameworks and tools through school projects and internships. These include but are not limited to:
- PHP
- Python
- Java
- Kotlin
- C
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Go
- NodeJS
- Angular (TS)
- React (JS/TS)

After having gained some experience with all these languages/frameworks over the years I decided to 'specialise' in 1~2 languages. The languages I decided to specialise in are JavaScript and Go.

Since I want to focus on webdevelopment the first language is probably not even a choice. JavaScript is essential for webdevelopment and also quite versatile as it can be used for backend and desktop development (through electron) as well. I have not tried any languages that compile to JavaScript other than TypeScript. Having used Java as my 'main' language during the first 2 years at college I quite enjoyed the typing (and other features) TypeScript added. The TypeScript configuration was (and sometimes still is) a bit complicated though.

As previously mentioned, my first 'main' language was Java. I used it for a variety of applications such as CLI, JavaFX and backend (Spring boot). Although I did enjoy programming in Java, I often struggled with particular subjects which made the experience 'less nice' so to say. These subjects are mainly related to packaging, dependency management, versions, licensing, etc. 

The first time I learned about Go was when I used it for a school project for which I wanted to use the Docker API, which had first party libraries for Python and Go. Having tried Python earlier, I decided to give Go a chance. The great standard library, straight forward dependency management and ease of compilation and deployment for various platforms is what made me love this language so far.

## Operating Systems

In short: I've used Windows the majority of my life, used Ubuntu Desktop for a few months, I currently use Ubuntu Server for servers and currently use macOS on my development machine.

## Hardware

I use an M1 MacBook Air to develop on.
I also have a Raspberry Pi 4 and Intel NUC both running Ubuntu server.
