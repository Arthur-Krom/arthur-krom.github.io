Just some information about my current 'tech stack'.

## Programming languages

As you might've read on the homepage; my name is Arthur and I am a Software Engineering student at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. Over the past couple of years I have come to work with various programming languages, frameworks and tools through school projects and internships. These include but are not limited to:

- PHP
- Python
- Java
- Kotlin
- C
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Go
- NodeJS
- Angular (TS)
- React (JS/TS)

After having gained some experience with all these languages/frameworks over the years I decided to 'specialise' in 1~2 languages. The languages I decided to specialise in are JavaScript and Go.

Since I want to focus on webdevelopment the first language is probably not even a choice. JavaScript is essential for webdevelopment and also quite versatile as it can be used for backend and desktop development (through electron) as well. I have not tried any languages that compile to JavaScript other than TypeScript. Having used Java as my 'main' language during the first 2 years at college I quite enjoyed the typing (and other features) TypeScript added. The TypeScript configuration was (and sometimes still is) a bit complicated though.

As previously mentioned, my first 'main' language was Java. I used it for a variety of applications such as CLI, JavaFX and backend (Spring boot). Although I did enjoy programming in Java, I often struggled with particular subjects which made the experience 'less nice' so to say. These subjects are mainly related to packaging, dependency management, versions, licensing, etc.

The first time I learned about Go was when I used it for a school project for which I wanted to use the Docker API, which had first party libraries for Python and Go. Having tried Python earlier, I decided to give Go a chance. The great standard library, straight forward dependency management and ease of compilation and deployment for various platforms is what made me love this language so far.

## Operating Systems

In short: I've used Windows the majority of my life, used Ubuntu Desktop for a few months, I currently use Ubuntu Server for servers and currently use macOS on my development machine.

While I consider myself to be fairly familiar with Ubuntu/Linux I still find this knowledge to be a bit fragmented. Things such as navigating through Linux filesystem, managing packages and editing files in Vim are for example, quite trivial to me now. On the other hand, there are still plenty of subjects where I can improve upon, such as a better understanding of security, logging, processes, services and daemons, and the Linux kernel itself. This is something I am currently trying to learn by applying these subjects into school/personal projects and by reading appropriate literature such as the book [Ubuntu Linux Bible](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Ubuntu+Linux+Bible-p-9781119722359) to improve upon these subjects.

## Hardware

I use an M1 MacBook Air to develop on.
I also have a Raspberry Pi 4 and Intel NUC both running Ubuntu Server.

## Tools

I am currently familiar with the following tools:

- VSCode
- Intellij IDEA
- Git
- Maven
- NPM
- Figma
- Webpack

The biggest tool that is missing from the above list is containerisation, which is something I am currently learning by taking the following [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery/).

Another tool/technology I am unfamiliar with, which I also consider to be essential, is CI/CD. After finishing the previously mentioned Docker course, I am planning on taking on CI/CD.
